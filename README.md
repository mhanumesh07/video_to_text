The issue of managing and extracting important insights from the huge number of information offered in these gatherings has grown increasingly prominent in today's workplace, where meetings are a critical component of cooperation and decision-making. This study addresses the problem by presenting a technique for Semantic Enrichment of Video Content Using NLP Transformer Networks. The key issue is the requirement for a streamlined way to rapidly discovering and obtaining critical meeting content. The study looks at two key methodologies: the Video to Text API approach, which involves a multi-step process that includes video ingestion, pre-processing, audio extraction, audio-to-text transcription, and post-processing; and the NLP Transformers approach, which uses state-of-the-art Transformer models like OpenAI's GPT-3 for highly precise audio-to-text transcription, enabling automatic closed captioning, content indexing, and enhanced accessibility. The findings highlight the usefulness of both techniques in improving meeting material accessibility and efficiency, resulting in more informative, accessible, and time-efficient professional interactions.
